# Data-Visualization-using-Power-BI

The challenge is to take on the role of a data analyst for a Adevnture Work Cycles, A Global Manufacturing Company which is looking to make a splash in the market and wants to design and deliver end-to-end business intelligence solutions.


To achieve that, I Created a dashboard on Microsoft PowerBi that required tons of cleaning and preparation.

The dashboard will assist the client with
1. Tracking core business KPIs like sales, revenue, profit, and returns.
2. Compare regional performance across sales territories.
3. Analyze performance and trending at the product level and forecast profits.
4. Use the data to identify the company's high-value customers.

Steps went through:
1. Data Connection:- (Text/csv)
2. Data Transformation (Power Query Editor):- Helps in modifying and creating new calculated columns. Keeps the track of applied steps.
3. Creating Data Model:- Setting relationships among fact tables and lookup tables.
4. DAX Expression:- Created some calculated columns and most importantly DAX measures.
5. In visual mode, explored various charts, graphs, treemaps, etc to come up with visuals shown on the report page.
